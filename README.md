# Time_State_3D
A 3D Godot Game that is open world (Work In Progress)

Disclaimer: All Assets are made by Me, and no outsourceing was done in the making of this project.
Another Disclaimer: This Game is Early in Development and is prone to bugs graphically or within the project code depending on how it is implemented or compiled

This Game is meant to be open world but due to time constraints has to be limited to roughly 4 Kilometers in size which is the equivalant to 1.54441 Miles Squared and the theme is to be a mix of time periods with weapons that are futurisitc in nature and "Old School" meaning Swords, Axes, and MORE!!!
